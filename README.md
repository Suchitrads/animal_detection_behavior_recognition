Animal Detection & Behavior Recognition - User Guide
This project detects animals in images and recognizes their behaviors using a YOLOv8 object detection model and a custom CNN classifier trained on annotated datasets.
üì¶ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Python (3.8+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas cloud)
- Git

Datasets
This project uses two datasets:
1. Animal Detection Dataset ‚Äì Used for training the YOLOv8 model.
2. Behavior Recognition Dataset ‚Äì Used for training the CNN classifier.

Both datasets are annotated and must be downloaded before running the project.

Steps After Downloading the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Suchitrads/animal-detection-behavior-recognition.git
   cd animal-detection-behavior-recognition

2. Setup the frontend:
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start

3. Setup the backend (Node.js + Flask):
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   Create a .env file based on .env.example and update values:
       PORT=5000
       MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
       FLASK_PORT=5000

4. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Download the trained model weights:
   Place them in backend

6. Run the services:
   Terminal 1 (backend): node server.js
   Terminal 2 (backend): python app.py
   Terminal 3 (frontend): npm start

7. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the backend.
- Models and datasets are not included in the repository due to size.
- Update paths in app.py to match your system setup.
